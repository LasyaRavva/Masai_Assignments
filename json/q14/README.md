# Enhanced Todo List (Q14)

Features:
- Add tasks (stored as objects with `id`, `text`, `completed`).
- Mark tasks as completed (checkbox, visually crossed out).
- Delete tasks.
- Live search to filter tasks by text.
- Persistence via `localStorage` (tasks survive reloads, including completion state).

How to run:
1. Open `index.html` in a browser (double-click or serve locally).
2. Type a task and click **Add Task** (or press Enter).
3. Use the checkbox to mark complete; click **Delete** to remove.
4. Use the search box to filter tasks in real time.

Files:
- `index.html` — UI layout and styles.
- `q14.js` — All todo logic (add/toggle/delete/search, localStorage persistence).
