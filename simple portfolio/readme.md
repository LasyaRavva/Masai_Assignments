# Responsive Personal Portfolio (Using AI Tools)

This project is a fully responsive personal portfolio created for the Masai assignment. It highlights a modern hero section, about highlights, an adaptive skills grid, and a contact call-to-action while meeting the desktop/tablet/mobile requirements.

## AI Tool Usage

- **Tool:** Cursor AI (GPT-5.1 Codex)
- **Workflow:** I prompted Cursor AI to draft the initial HTML structure for the required sections. The tool produced a starter layout that I iteratively refined inside the same session.

## Manual Improvements

- Rewrote copy to sound personal and crafted a unique neon-night color palette.
- Designed the responsive layout, including the CSS-only hamburger navigation for mobile.
- Added animated hero elements, stat blocks, and hover effects for the skills grid.
- Ensured all sections (Header, Hero, About, Skills, Contact, Footer) satisfy the assignment rubric and accessibility best practices.
- Documented AI usage and setup steps in this README.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser—no build tools required.
